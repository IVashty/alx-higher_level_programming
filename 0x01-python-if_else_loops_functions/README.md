### TASKS:
0. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

    - You can find the source code here
    - The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
    - You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
    - The output of the program should be:
        - The number, followed by
            - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
            - if the number is 0: is zero
            - if the number is less than 0: is negative
                followed by a new line
1. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
2. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
    - You can only use one print function with string format
   - You can only use one loop in your code
   - You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
   - You are not allowed to import any module

3. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
   - Print all the letters except q and e
   - You can only use one print function with string format
   - You can only use one loop in your code
   - You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
   - You are not allowed to import any module
4. Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
   - You can only use one print function with string format
   - You can only use one loop in your code
   - You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
   - You are not allowed to import any module

5. Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
    - Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    - Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
    - The last number should be followed by a new line
    - You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format
   - You can only use one loop in your code
    - You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
    - You are not allowed to import any module

6. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
    - Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    - The two digits must be different
    01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
   - Print only the smallest combination of two digits
    Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
   - The last number should be followed by a new line
    You can only use no more than 3 print functions with string format
   - You can only use no more than 2 loops in your code
   - You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
   - You are not allowed to import any module
7. Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
    - Prototype: `def islower(c)`:
   - Returns True if c is lowercase
   - Returns False otherwise
   - You are not allowed to import any module
   - You are not allowed to use `str.upper()` and `str.isupper()`
   - Tips: `ord()`
You don’t need to understand __import__

8. Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
   - Prototype: `def uppercase(str)`:
   - You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format
   - You can only use one loop in your code
   - You are not allowed to import any module
   - You are not allowed to use `str.upper()` and `str.isupper()`
   - Tips: `ord()`
You don’t need to understand __import__

9. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
   - Prototype: def print_last_digit(number):
   - Returns the value of the last digit
    - You are not allowed to import any module
You don’t need to understand __import__
