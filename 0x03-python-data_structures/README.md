### TASKS:
----------------

0. Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

    -Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
    - Format: one integer per line. See example
    - You are not allowed to import any module
    - You can assume that the list only contains integers
    - You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
    - You have to use `str.format()` to print integers

1. Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
    - Prototype: `def element_at(my_list, idx):`
    - If `idx` is negative, the function should return None
    - If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
    - You are not allowed to import any module
    - You are not allowed to use try/except

2. Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
   - Prototype: `def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):`
    - If `idx` is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
    - If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
    - You are not allowed to import any module
   - You are not allowed to use try/except

3. Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
    - Prototype: `def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
   - Format: one integer per line. See example
   - You are not allowed to import any module
    - You can assume that the list only contains integers
   - You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
   - You have to use `str.format()` to print integers

4. Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
    - Prototype: `def new_in_list(my_list, `idx`, element):`
    - If `idx` is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
    - If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return a copy of the original list
    - You are not allowed to import any module
    - You are not allowed to use try/except
