### TASKS:

0. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
        - Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):`
    - matrix is a 2 dimensional array
    - Returns a new matrix:
        Same size as matrix
        - Each value should be the square of the value of the input
    - Initial matrix should __not__ be modified
    - You are __not__ allowed to import any module
    - You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.

1. Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

    - Prototype: `def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):`
   - `my_list` is the initial list
    - search is the element to replace in the list
    - replace is the new element
   - You are __not__ allowed to import any module
