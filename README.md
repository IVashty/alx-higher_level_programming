# SPRINT 2:Alx-higher_level_programming

## Welcome to the Python world!

The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode.

Enjoy!

#Getting started with python
*What is Python?
![forks_prepforpython](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Flyingcircus_2.jpg)

Python is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido Van Rossum.
Python is most praised for its elegant syntax and readable code, if you are just beginning your programming career Python suits you best. With Python you can do everything from GUI development, Web application, System administration tasks, Financial calculation, Data Analysis, Visualization and list goes on.
Python is interpreted language, when you run python program an interpreter will parse python program line by line basis, as compared to compiled languages like C or C++, where compiler first compiles the program and then start running.
Python doesn't require you to define variable data type ahead of time. Python automatically infers the data type of the variable based on the type of value it contains.
Programs written in Python are usually 1/3 or 1/5 of the Java code. It means we can write less code in Python to achieve the same thing as in Java.
Okay, what I can start building in Python?

Pretty much anything you want. For e.g:

    -GUI applications.
    -Web apps.
    -Scrape data from websites.
    -Analyse Data.
    -System administration utilities.
    -Game Development.
    -Data Science and 
                        many more....

To run the program type the following command: `python <file_name.py>`
